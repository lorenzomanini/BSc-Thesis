\chapter{Geometry of probability distributions}
Quantum states, as we will see, can be thought of as a generalization of probability distributions. In this chapter, we will study probability distributions from a geometrical point of view, and in this framework, we shall prove the Cramer-Rao bound. We will only consider probability distributions defined on finite sample spaces since this is all we need for finite-dimensional pure quantum states.
